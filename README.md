# Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall using UFW (Linux)

##  Objective
Configure basic firewall rules using UFW on Linux to block or allow specific network traffic.

---

##  Steps Performed

### Step 1: Install UFW and Enable It
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw enable

### Step 3: Block Port 23 (Telnet)

sudo ufw deny 23/tcp

### Step 4: Allow Port 22 (SSH)

sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

## Summary

This task demonstrated how to:

    * Use UFW for firewall management in Linux
    * Block insecure ports (Telnet)
    * Allow secure ports (SSH)
    * Test and validate the rules
    * Safely remove the test rule

Firewall rules are essential to manage and secure network access. This exercise gave hands-on experience in doing that with UFW.
